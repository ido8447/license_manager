#     INSTRUCTIONS
#######################################################################
#  1. Please   replace  "Cadence_SERVER"  with  hostname  of your machine
#     in line   "SERVER Cadence_SERVER  &lt;hostid&gt; 5280".
#  2. Please replace the relative path(  eg. ./cdslmd   ) to absolute path
#     in the DAEMON line(s).
#  3. Cadence now ships a complete license file for each server, so combining
#     license files with a VENDOR_STRING value other than DEMO is no longer
#     permitted.  Please contact your field administrator if you believe that
#     product licenses are missing from this file.
#  4. Some  e-mail utilities ( commonly on PC or  Macintosh  systems ) may
#     modify the text of an e-mailed license file,   changes such as  word
#     or line wrapping or  subdivision into  multiple sections,  when they
#     receive or forward this file.  The resulting keys will be unreadable
#     by the software security.To avoid this, these changes must be undone
#     or the e-mail utility options disabled.
